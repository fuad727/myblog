                        The Dhaka river port has a recorded existence since the Mughal Empire. The Mughal viceroy's fortress was built by the port in the 17th century. Dhaka's strategic riverine location in Bengal made it a hub for Eurasian traders, including Armenians, the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British. The city's riverbanks were dotted with mansions, bazaars and warehouses.[3] The bustling old city was known as the Venice of the East.[4] It was used for exports of cotton muslin, silk, jute, rice and other goods. During British rule, the riverfront hosted the offices of the Magistrate and Collector; and became the center of the colonial city.[5] Bengali aristocrats built numerous palaces on the riverfront, including Ahsan Manzil and Ruplal House. The British developed ghats (wharfs), such as Wiseghat, Sadarghat and Northbrook Hall ghat.[6] Paddle steamers were a common sight. The Viceroy of India often traveled by ship from Calcutta to Dhaka's riverside palaces for balls and parties.

                        The Barisal river port has a recorded existence since the Mughal Empire. It was then called "Gird-e-Bandar", a river station which was known for the trade of salt, spices, and woods. It was turned into Barisal Bandar (port) during the British rule after the town committee was established in 1869 and achieved municipal status in 1876.

Steamers first began to use the rivers of Barisal shortly before 1880. In 1884 Bengal Central Flotilla Company introduced regular steamer service between Barisal and Khulna. Subsequently, Barisal became an important steamer centre for both inter-district routes and as a station on the main route from other districts of Bangladesh to Calcutta and as a terminus for branch lines from Chittagong, Noakhali and Madaripur. There existed also a number of feeder services in the interior of the district. It later became the regional headquarters of Indian General Navigation, River Steam Navigation, Indian General River Steamer companies in British period to connect North and Eastern part of Bengal with the capital city.
